
Thank you for downloading the free version of EasyRoads3D

This package includes separate packages for v2 and the v3 beta.

V3 is an entirely new road system.

Conform the asset store guidelines both packages will be imported in the folder /Assets/EasyRoads3D Free/. Be careful if you do not want to mix version specific assets, you may want to import v2 first and rename the folder in for example ”EasyRoads3D v2”.
